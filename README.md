# ChequeDetection
Detect different parts of a Bank Cheque
## Dataset source
The dataset was downloaded from: [IDRBT Cheque Image Dataset](https://www.idrbt.ac.in//icid.html).

You can also find the dataset here: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/pranav10000/chequedetection)

## Annotations
The annotations were done using the [SuperAnnotate Tool](https://superannotate.com/).

The tool exports a separate `.json` file for every image containing the bounding box and class information. It does not export the size of image though.
## Training

The model was trained on Kaggle GPU(P100) for 5000 steps, 0.7 loss. You can check the kaggle notebook/kernel [here](https://www.kaggle.com/pranav10000/cheque-detection): 

## Prediction
The [Inference Notebook](https://github.com/pranavmp-10-000/ChequeDetection/blob/main/ChequeDetection_Inference_tf2.ipynb) can be used to run the prediction on the model trained.
